# Bob’s Burger Biz

Dataset analysis for menu performance, customer behavior, and pricing/profitability. 


A data science project inspired by Bob’s Burgers.
The goal: treat the fictional restaurant like a real business and use data to uncover insights that can help Bob (finally) make a profit.

This repository contains three completed analysis projects, each addressing a critical business question with data cleaning, analysis, visualizations, and mini-reports.

## Structure
P1: Menu Performance Analysis

Business Question: Which burgers should become permanent fixtures on the menu?

Cleaned and standardized raw menu data.

Analyzed burger performance across specials and categories.

Visualized top-performing burgers and laggards.

**Insight:** Puns do sell! Burgers with witty names performed ~20% better on average.

P2: Customer Behavior Analysis

Business Question: Who are Bob’s customers, and what drives their visits?

Cleaned survey and visits data (200 entries).

Calculated mean, median, quartiles for visit frequency.

Segment-level analysis (families, singles, regulars, casuals).

**Insight:** Families and regulars are Bob’s core — visits are consistent, but attracting younger singles could unlock growth.

P3: Pricing & Profitability Analysis

Business Question: Are menu prices sustainable, and where is Bob losing money?

Cleaned inconsistent cost/price/margin data.

Fixed mismatched profit margin calculations.

Visualized profitability by category and burger.

**Insight:** Some items are underpriced (low margin) despite popularity — opportunity to adjust pricing without losing customers.
